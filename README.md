# LazyRiderBot
Lazy Rider wants to know which train door to board to alight near an escalator at his destination. Lazy Rider Bot will help Lazy Rider.

## Use Cases
- As a Lazy Rider, I want to know which train door to board such that when I alight, I alight near a lift or an escalator to my fare gates.
- As a Lazy Rider, I do not want to walk to the information board, but I still want to know how long it takes to travel to my destination station

## Getting Started
- Get familiar with some Python. It's really easy to pick up. Just don't put any semicolons.
- The starting code is based off this [tutorial](https://www.codementor.io/garethdwyer/building-a-telegram-bot-using-python-part-1-goi5fncay), have a read for this
- Refer to the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) as and when.
- We'll do Branching workflow. Please don't push directly to master or I'll fuck you up.

## To-do
- Continue the tutorial.
- Ask SMRT, SBS Transit or LTA to give us data on platform layouts or ask support@sgtrains.com. Worse case is crowdsource.
-- We can work on hardcoded info yet.
- Probably host the server on firebase
- Is a DB for the station info really needed? Or can we just hardcode it into some file.
- Have a Wiki to put mockups.
